# Bact.js

[Modern Act](https://github.com/ICe1BotMaker/modern-act) didn't go as well as I thought, and I was very disappointed, so I made a new one.

### An improvement

- The existing **Modern Act** used the express module, but **Bact.js** implemented the server directly using the http module.

- Overall, the serious security concerns of the **Modern Act** have been improved.

### Installation
 
_~~(Package **act.js** already exists and has been replaced with **bact.js**)~~_

```
$ npm install bact
```
